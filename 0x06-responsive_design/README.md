# RESPONSIVE DESIGN

The use of mobile devices to surf the web continues to grow at an astronomical pace, and these devices are often constrained by display size and require a different approach to how content is laid out on the screen.

Responsive web design, originally defined by [Ethan Marcotte](https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/), responds to the needs of the users and the devices they're using. The layout changes based on the size and capabilities of the device.

A multitude of different screen sizes exist across phones, "phablets," tablets, desktops, game consoles, TVs, and even wearables. Screen sizes are always changing, so it's important that your site can adapt to any screen size, today or in the future. In addition, devices have different features with which we interact with them. For example some of your visitors will be using a touchscreen. Modern responsive design considers all of these things to optimize the experience for everyone.
